				<h2>Resistor</h2>
				<p>A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit
					element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide
					voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that
					can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat may be used as part of motor controls, in power
					distribution systems, or as test loads for generators. Fixed resistors have resistances that only change
					slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage. Variable resistors can be used to adjust circuit
					elements (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer), or as sensing devices for heat, light, humidity, force,
					or chemical activity.</p>

				<h2>Speaker</h2>
				<p>A loudspeaker (commonly referred to as a speaker or speaker driver) is an electroacoustic transducer that
					converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound. A speaker system, also often simply referred
					to as a speaker or loudspeaker, comprises one or more such speaker drivers, an enclosure, and electrical
					connections possibly including a crossover network. The speaker driver can be viewed as a linear motor
					attached to a diaphragm which couples that motor's movement to motion of air, that is, sound.</p>

				<h2>Sensor</h2>
				<p>Sensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons (tactile sensor) and lamps
					which dim or brighten by touching the base, and in innumerable applications of which most people are never
					aware. With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have
					expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure and flow measurement, for example into MARG
					sensors. </p>
